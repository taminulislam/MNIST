PROPOSED ABSTRACT:
================================================================================

Fashion item classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with
significant applications in e-commerce and retail automation. This paper
presents a comprehensive empirical study of neural network performance on
the Fashion-MNIST dataset, analyzing three critical aspects of deep learning
model behavior: classification error patterns, learning dynamics over training
epochs, and data efficiency. We implement a baseline feedforward neural
network and systematically evaluate its performance under varying conditions.

Through confusion matrix analysis, we identify that visually similar categories
such as shirts, t-shirts, and pullovers exhibit the highest misclassification
rates, with shirt-to-t-shirt confusion accounting for up to 12.9% of errors
in the shirt category. Our learning curve analysis over training epochs (1-10)
reveals rapid convergence within the first 5 epochs, achieving 87.07% test
accuracy, with marginal improvements thereafter. Most significantly, our data
volume experiments demonstrate diminishing returns in model performance:
increasing training data from 5,000 to 60,000 samples yields only 4.34%
improvement in test accuracy (83.26% to 87.60%), with the steepest gains
occurring in the 5,000-20,000 sample range.

These findings provide practical insights for practitioners regarding optimal
training duration, minimum data requirements, and expected performance
boundaries for fashion classification tasks. Our results suggest that for
simple feedforward architectures on Fashion-MNIST, 20,000-30,000 training
samples and 5-6 training epochs represent an optimal balance between
computational cost and model performance. The paper contributes empirical
evidence for data-efficient deep learning practices in the fashion domain.
